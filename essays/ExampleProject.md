**Executive Summary**

*Purpose and Research*

Valve Corporation is a company that has been developing hardware and software for years, using computers that have been bought years ago to aid in software and hardware development. Let's think about if the company has decided to either lease or buy new computers as the old computers are outdated. The purpose of this report is to go over the benefits and drawbacks of leasing and buying computers and to recommend plans to balance the benefits and drawbacks of leasing and buying computers. 

Throughout this report, I will be using sources that I have researched from the Leeward Library databases to find popular computer components and differences in leasing versus buying. To be specific, I researched within the Britannica, ProQuest, and Statista databases.

*Key Points*

Studies have shown that buying equipment is beneficial if we can assume that the resource’s price will increase over time, meaning it is beneficial in the long run with the ability to get some of the cash invested into the equipment back. Buying equipment may decrease working capital. Lease financing is considered intermediate-term financing, with tax advantages. Research has shown that, when the user has a lower tax rate than the lessor, the user benefits from the contract. Some drawbacks of leasing include lost equity and buying or leasing more equipment after the contract ends.

*Recommendations for Purchasing Computers*

Some suggestions offered for purchasing computers comprise of: 
- Lease a variety of computers with different components suitable for each respected team or group.
- Lease computers with the same components for most groups and buy computers with different components for groups that may experiment with them.

**1. Introduction**

Valve Corporation has been a company that specializes in making software and hardware for those that want entertainment. Our company uses computers to test and develop our products. As the computers that were originally bought are years old, the company has decided to get new computers. In terms of getting new computers, we must decide whether we want to lease or buy new computers for the company.

With newer computers, Valve Corporation would be able to use computers and components that our consumers are familiar with, such as DirectX 12 GPUs and AMD Processor (Alsop). The new computers would allow our development teams to create software and hardware that would be most efficient for our customers. Our company is focusing on buying or leasing new computers. A lease is considered to be a contract that gives one’s property for a certain amount of time (Lease). 

Valve Corporation has been looking into either buying or leasing computers with computer components that will benefit the company in the long run. The purpose of this report is to go over the benefits and drawbacks of leasing and buying computers and to recommend plans to balance the benefits and drawbacks of leasing and buying computers. 

**2.1 Background**

Valve Corporation has been around for years, focusing on a consumer base online. As most of the work is online, we use computers that were bought years ago to develop, code, test, and improve our products. Due to using older computers, we’ve been not keeping up with the latest technology that our customers are using. With this, we’ve decided to either lease or buy computers, which is where our problem starts. If we lease the equipment, it will be beneficial in the short run with tax benefits (Musumeci and O’Brien 687). If we buy equipment, it will be beneficial in the long run, being more cost-effective (Brady 14).

**2.2 Methodology**

I have used the Leeward databases to research the topic of leasing versus buying. To be specific, I used an encyclopedia database to understand what leasing is. I’ve also used the statistics database to obtain information on what components are currently popular. Lastly, I used periodic databases like ProQuest to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of leasing and buying.

**2.3 Scope**

The report includes information about buying property and details about leasing property, including tax benefits and rates. 

Information about the benefits between leasing and buying in the short run will not be included. Details regarding borrowing rates and their effects on leasing will not be discussed as it is complicated and may require more research to understand.

**2.4 Discussion of Findings**

There are two categories to summarize my findings: Benefits of Buying and Lease Financing.

*2.4.1 Benefits of Buying*

When it comes to land and buildings, buying is advantageous as it allows the value of these properties to increase over time (Business Finance). With equipment purchasing, part of the payments can be recovered through “defined annual tax depreciation percentages” (Coker 20). Purchasing equipment is more cost-effective in the long run as the “acquisition cost is spread over a longer period of time” (Brady 14). When it comes to purchasing equipment, monthly purchase payments may be higher than leasing payments (Brady 14). Purchasing equipment may also impact working capital negatively, causing the buyer to use debt (Coker 21).

*2.4.2 Lease Financing*

Lease Financing is considered to be intermediate-term financing (“Business Finance”). Lease financing usually involves property, such as land and buildings. Leasing can be beneficial, presenting lower debt-to-asset ratios, and could be cheaper if the lessor can “perform nonfinancial services” (“Business Finance”). Leasing has tax advantages if the lessee has lower tax rates than the lessor, but research has shown that the lessee can also gain tax advantages if they have a higher tax rate (Musumeci and O’Brien 687). Some drawbacks in leasing are that, in the long term, may be more expensive than purchasing as we are unable to build equity with equipment and will need to either purchase or lease more equipment after the contract ends (Brady 14).

**3. Interpretation of Findings**

The details from the Discussion of Findings have led to these conclusions:
- Equipment that is bought should be seen as beneficial in the long run for Valve Corporation.
- If Valve Corporation does not have good working capital, we should not buy.
- If we wish to recover some of the cash contributed towards computers, buying the computers would meet the requirements.
- Leasing may be beneficial to the company if Valve Corporation has lower tax rates. 
- If we decide to lease, find a lessor that can perform nonfinancial services.
- Valve Corporation can have a better debt-to-asset ratio to present to lenders if we lease.
- Valve Corporation should not lease the computers in the long run.

**4. Recommendations**

After analyzing the findings and conclusions, I present some recommendations: 
- Lease a variety of computers with different components suitable for each respected team or group.
- Lease computers with the same components for most groups and buy computers with different components for groups that may experiment with them for long-term use.

**5. Conclusion**

Valve Corporation has been looking into either leasing or buying computers. Buying computers is beneficial in the long run but negatively impacts working capital. Leasing comes with multiple benefits, such as tax advantages and fewer expenses, but doesn’t build equity. Valve Company should lease the majority of the computers they wish to obtain and buy the rest for teams that would use the computers for experimentation in the long run.
